# A Pathway to Protect 30% of Coastal Waters by 2030

This repository contains the analysis for *Rechberger et al. (in review)*, *A Pathway to Protect 30% of Coastal Waters by 2030*. The analysis estimates current protection levels of coastal waters (0–12nm) and projects the number of new Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) required to meet 30x30 targets.

- `01_MPAs_we_have.qmd` - Analysis of current MPA coverage in coastal waters.
- `01_MPAs_we_need.qmd` - Calculation of the number of MPAs needed to achieve 30% protection.
