A Pathway to Protect 30% of Coastal Waters by 2030

This repository contains the analysis for Rechberger et al. (in review), A Pathway to Protect 30% of Coastal Waters by 2030. The analysis estimates current protection levels of coastal waters (0â€“12nm) and projects the number of new Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) required to meet 30x30 targets.
